The book "**Deep Learning: DL1943 Cheatsheet: DL/AI/ML Research, Engineering, Optimization & System Design**" is the only book you need to master Deep Learning (DL) concepts.

This book include:

* Chapters covering all core concepts in DL research, engineering and optimization including:
  * **Basic concepts** like Perceptron, Gradient Descent
  * All **basic terms** like epoch, topK and basic ops like MaxPool
  * Core techniques like **INT8 Quantization**
  * **Deep Learning System Design** (with examples)
  * **Numerical Analysis** concepts like INT32 IEEE754, **emulating FP64 using FP32**.
  * **Optimization techniques** across:
    * Assembly instructions like AVX512 VNNI
    * Algorithmic optimizations for DL operations like MatMul
    * Graph level operations
  * and much more.
* Each chapter is a **CHEATSHEET**. It includes to-the-point explanation and relevant code snippets.
* Each concept can be covered quickly in at most 6 minutes.
* Over 350 DL/AI concepts have been covered.

With this, you will be able to crack any Deep Learning Coding Interview easily.

After reading this book, you will:
* Master Deep Learning/ Artificial Intelligence.
* Clear **interviews for full-time positions at high-tech companies**. Good enough for:
  * Software Engineer 2/3, Machine Learning or Senior Software Engineer, AI/ML GenAI or ML Analyst at @Google (L3/L4/L5)
  * Software Engineer, Machine Learning (E4/E5/E6) at @Meta
  * Senior Deep Learning Systems Software Engineer - AI or AI Developer Technology Engineer at @NVIDIA
  * Kernel Software Engineer - AI/ML GPU or Senior Machine Learning Software Engineer at @AMD
  * Lead Engineer, Senior-C/C++, machine learning at @Qualcomm
  * Machine Learning Engineer at @Microsoft (Level 60 to 66)
  * And much more.

This book is for:
* Students and developers preparing for Coding Interviews specifically for Machine Learning/Deep Learning/GenAI positions.
* Experienced developers who wanted to revise their Deep Learning skills.
* Students who need a coding sheet to revise DL/AI/ML topics quickly.

Get started with this book and change the equation of your career.
